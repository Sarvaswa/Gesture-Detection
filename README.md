# Gesture-Detection
Color-based gesture detection in Python-OpenCV

# Description
A Color-based Gesture Detection system built in python. It uses colors in certain color range to detect skin and assumes it to be a human hand. The system provides a visual output with a convex hull around the hand (multiple possible) with corner points marked in red as fingers.

# Requirements
Python 3.5
OpenCV 3.2

# Usage
Run the Gesture.py file as it is. A window would appear as a visual output. Make sure the field of view of the camera does not contain any skin-colored objects (faces, arms, walls, boxes, etc.). Keep your hand in-front of the camera and watch the output. To end the program, press **SPACEBAR**.

# Testing and Progress
The code has been tested on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 and works fine.
The code is still under development and improvements are under way.
Please report any issues with the program.
All suggestions are welcomed.

**Enjoy :)**
