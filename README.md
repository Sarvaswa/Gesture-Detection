# Gesture-Detection
Color-based gesture detection in Python-OpenCV

# Description
A Color-based Gesture Detection system built in python. It uses colors in certain color range to detect skin and assumes it to be a human hand. The system provides a visual output with a convex hull around the hand (multiple possible) with corner points marked in red as fingers.

# Requirements
* Python 3.5
* OpenCV 3.2

# Usage
* Run the Gesture.py file as it is.
* A window would appear as a visual output.
* Make sure the field of view of the camera does not contain any skin-colored objects (faces, arms, walls, boxes, etc.).
* Keep your hand in-front of the camera and watch the output.
* To end the program, press SPACEBAR.

# Testing and Progress
* The code has been tested on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 and works fine.
* The code is still under development and improvements are under way.
* Please report any issues with the program.

All suggestions are welcome.

**Enjoy :)**
