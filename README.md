# Gesture-Detection
Color-based gesture detection in Python-OpenCV

# Description
A Color-based Gesture Detection system built in python. It uses colors in certain color range to detect skin and assumes it to be a human hand. The system provides a visual output with a convex hull around the hand (multiple possible) with corner points marked in red as fingers.

# Requirements
Python 3.5
OpenCV 3.2

# Testing and Progress
The code has been tested on Windows 8, 8.1 and 10 and works fine.
The code is still under development and improvements are under way.

Enjoy :)
